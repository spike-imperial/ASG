# ASG

Answer Set Grammars (ASGs) are a new type of context sensitive grammar,
which make use of Answer Set Programming to encode context sensitive
constraints on top of context free grammars. ASGs were first presented
at AAAI 2019 in the paper "Representing and Learning Grammars in Answer
Set Programming".

This repository contains instructions for downloading and installing the
ASG solver and several example ASG input files.

Any questions regarding the ASG solver should be sent to
